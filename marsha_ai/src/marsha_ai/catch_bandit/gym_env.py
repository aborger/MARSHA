# The code for AI method 3. A bandit problem with a continuous action space
# where the action is a tupe with continuous values (latent grasp, catch time/position)
# calculated deterministicly

# The latent grasp is a value or set of values that will generate a grasp deterministicly in the object space.

# The catch time is the time slice of the catch, the time slice will then be used to 
# determine the position of the object at that time

# The observation space is also continuous:
# (3D object position, 3D linear velocity)

# Recurrent policy will not work with the DDPG algorithm.
